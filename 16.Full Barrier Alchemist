/* The height of Edward is H units and he has an alchemic life force of L units. 
Moreover, he can duck by Y1 units and jump by height Y2 units (as explained in the figures).
He starts crossing barriers in sequence, starting from barrier 1 till the barrier N.
Whenever he can't pass a barrier by ducking or jumping (considered passed even when the barrier just touches him), he uses Alchemy to break the barrier. 
However, this costs him a single unit of his alchemic life force.
If after breaking a barrier no life force is left, Edward gets completely exhausted, unable to pass that barrier.
How many barriers can Edward cross?And remember never to call him a pipsqueak if his height is too short!*/
