/* Chef is planning a heist in the reserve bank of Chefland. They are planning to hijack the bank for 
D days and print the money. The initial rate of printing the currency is 
P dollars per day and they increase the production by Q dollars after every interval of d days. 
For example, after d days the rate is P+Q dollars per day, and after 2d days the rate is P+2Q dollars per day, and so on.
Output the amount of money they will be able to print in the given period.*/
