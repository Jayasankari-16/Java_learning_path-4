/* Chef is playing a game with his friend Misha. They have a pile containg N coins. 
Players take alternate turns, removing some coins from the pile. 
On each turn, a player can remove either one coin or coins equal to some prime power (i.e. px coins, where p - prime number and x - positive integer).
Game ends when the pile becomes empty. The player who can not make a move in his turn loses.
Chef plays first. Your task is to find out who will win the game, provided that both of the player play optimally.*/
