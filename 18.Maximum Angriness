/& Alice and Bob were playing a game yet again but this time, Bob already lost the game. Now he wants to take revenge.
Bob saw a jigsaw puzzle which was solved by Alice and decided to jumble the puzzle pieces again. There are 
N puzzle pieces in a line numbered from 
1 to N in increasing order and he has K minutes before Alice catches him.Bob can swap any two pieces of the puzzle. Each swap takes 
1 minute, and so Bob can make at most K swaps.
Let Ai denote the piece in the i-th position after Bob finishes making his swaps.
Alice's angriness is defined to be the number of pairs (i,j) such that 
1≤i<j≤N Bob would like to make Alice as angry as possible, so he asks for your help: if he performs his swaps optimally, what is the maximum angriness he can achieve?*/
