/* It's possible for all the digits displayed on a digital clock in the hours:minutes format to be identical. The time shown above (3:33) is an example of such a situation.
\Other examples are 2:2 and 1:11. Note that the digits of 33:33 are identical, but it is not a valid time on a usual digital clock.
The above example was for a usual 24-hour format digital clock. Let's consider a more general clock,
where an hour lasts M minutes and a day lasts H hours (therefore, the clock can show any number of hours between 0 and H-1, inclusive,
and any number of minutes between 0 and M-1, inclusive). Both the hours and the minutes are shown without leading zeroes in decimal notation and their separator (e.g., ':') doesn't matter.
Can you tell how many minutes during a day will the digital clock have identical digits displayed on it?*/
