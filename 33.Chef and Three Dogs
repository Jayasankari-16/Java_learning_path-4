/* Chef has three dogs sitting at the vertices of an equilateral triangle.
The length of each side of the triangle equals to s meters.
Chef gives the command "Start!" and each dog starts to run with constant speed v meters per second.
At each moment, each dog is running towards the dog just right to him (in counter-clockwise direction).
Therefore, their trajectories are forming some spirals that converging to one point as illustrated below.*/
