/* Ujan is a software developer. He is developing a software that takes two integers L and R and outputs the count of integers in the sequence L,L+1,…,R−1,R whose sum of digits (SOD) is divisible by 3.
He has developed the user interface (UI) quite easily.
He is having a hard time finding the logic to solve the problem.
As you are not only a good friend of Ujan but also a good problem solver, he asks you to help him out.
Can you solve the problem for your friend, Ujan?*/
