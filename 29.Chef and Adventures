/* Mysterious Chefland... Recently, Chef realised that Discuss, the educational system of Chefland, is out of date. 
Therefore, he is trying to find ways to update the infrastructure in the country. One possible way is to move all materials from Discuss to Discourse.
Chef will have access to Discourse if his knowledge and power become exactly equal to N and M respectively. Initially, he has power 1 and knowledge 1.
Chef can perform actions of the following types to improve his skills:
solve a problem — increase his knowledge by X do a push-up — increase his power by Y install ShareChat to keep in touch with friends — increase both knowledge and power by 1 Chef can only install ShareChat at most once. 
The remaining actions may be performed any number of times and the actions may be performed in any order.
Help Chef find out whether it is possible to move from Discuss to Discourse.*/
