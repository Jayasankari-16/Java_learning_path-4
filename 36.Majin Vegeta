/* Babidi has summoned Majin Vegeta. He orders him to kill Supreme Kai. But Vegeta wants to get out of his control.
Babidi has laid out a trap. Vegeta is standing at the 
nth level of mind control. In order to defeat Babidi's trap, he needs to reach 
mth level. The levels are continuous increasing integers. At each increment of level, 
nth to (n+1)th level, for example, the energy used is - number of distinct prime factors of n.
Vegeta needs your help in order to figure out how much total minimum energy he needs to defeat Babidi's trap.
The total energy is the sum of energy used at each increment of a level.In the calculation of energy, n and m are inclusive.*/
