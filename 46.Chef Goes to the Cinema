/* Subway trains in Chefcity allow Chef to move between any pair of adjacent stations in one minute, regardless of the distance between them.
Chef can also move by walking; his walking speed is one unit of distance in one minute.
Chef can enter or exit the subway at any station.
Chef has decided to go to the cinema. The only cinema in Chefcity is located at point X. 
(Note that the cinema can be placed at the same point as a subway station.)
Help Chef determine the minimum possible time required to get to the cinema from his house.*/
