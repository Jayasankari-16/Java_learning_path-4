/* A holiday weekend is coming up, and Hotel Bytelandia needs to find out if it has enough rooms to accommodate all potential guests.
A number of guests have made reservations. Each reservation consists of an arrival time, and a departure time.
The hotel management has hired you to calculate the maximum number of guests that will be at the hotel simultaneously.
Note that if one guest arrives at the same time another leaves, they are never considered to be at the hotel simultaneously (see the second example).*/
